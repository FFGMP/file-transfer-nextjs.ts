## Creation Process

Technologies used: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Zustand and jszip

This project was primarily developed using the powerful and versatile Next.js framework. The core objective of this endeavor was to create a robust and efficient file upload service that enables users to share files seamlessly over the web.

The design aspect of the page was not the primary focus during the development phase. Instead, the emphasis was placed on functionality and performance. The goal was to ensure that the file upload process was not only fast but also reliable and user-friendly.

By prioritizing speed and efficiency, the project aims to provide a superior user experience. Users can quickly upload their files and share them with others, making it an invaluable tool for both personal and professional use.

Despite the design not being the central focus, the page maintains a clean and straightforward interface. This simplicity in design further enhances the user experience by making the service easy to navigate and use.

## Lessons Learned

I knew a little about Next.js and its functionalities before starting this project. However, by the end of it, I had significantly improved my skills with this framework.

## Features

- ✔️ Upload functionality
- ✔️ Download functionality
- ❌ File encryption
- ❌ Keep files behind a password

## Running the Project Locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
